READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING THE CODES

please run the the codes in the following steps, without removing the global environment
1. Run "1. Data preprocessing, Clustering and Train Regression Model.R" to implement kmeans 		clustering, and train the regression machine.

2. Run "2. Train Classification Model.R" to train the classification machine.


3. Run "3. Final machine.R" to feed the "Current" records into the combined model 
	as described in the report (appendix B)

OR

3a. Run "3a. Only classification.R" to implement only the classification 
	model as described in the report (appendix B)



4. To generate reports mentioned in Appendix D of the report,
run "4. Appendix D.R"
